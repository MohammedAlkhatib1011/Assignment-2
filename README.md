# Assignment-2
On the 6th of Decemeber we had a visit to UTM digital, it was a great and insightful visit the lasted for about and hour. They showed taught me how a support teams works based on how complex is the problem, how important is teamwork and how they work as a team, and when they do brainstormaing in the meetings room. What was more excited for me is the server room
seeing it for the first time after years of studying it made me relazied all the things i have lernt about it and how it looks like in real life, how netowrks work and connected to the servers, where the data are stored and how secure are the servers and cold, they showed us all of these things in the visit. The activities benefit us as a student the activitie spark excitement/interest on me, after seeing the servers and how the netowrks work we want to learn more about it.
